Here is the test for you. Please spend no more than about 2 hours on it and feel free to put comments / tests in where you might improve on certain functionality if you had more time to do so. Hopefully you can learn something from the test as I've tried to keep it interesting by integrating with the 3rd party Mandrill API that we already use for our email services. This is the back-end that drives MailChimp if you are not familiar with it.
